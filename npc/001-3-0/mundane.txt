// Description:
//    Mundane (anagram of Unnamed) is Mona's father
//    He likes to smoke cigarettes while looking for the strange sounds.
//    He is an old bowman of the Legion. He was married but it is not clear
//    what happened to his wife.
// Lore Problems:
//    If he is missing for a week already, how is he eating anyway?
//    Also, is he afraid of blubs/rattos or of Green Slimes?

// Note: Jesusalva is not someone to care a lot with code styling, and he uses
// a convention of his own, gumi will need to cleanse the code before it gets
// compliant with Evol Coding Style Guidelines.
// Note 2: Logout is not handled. Making logout at an instanced map may randomly
// warp you back to Drasil Island (000-1) or something like that. I don't know.
// This behavior remains to be checked.
