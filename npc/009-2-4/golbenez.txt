// Description (SPOILERS):
//    Golbenez, a very dangerous, evil AND cruel woman from a parallel dimension.
//    After being summoned by Savaric, she betrayed him and made the Inn in her
//    leisure place. Later, she invaded The Mana World, kidnapped Santa to obtain
//    enough spiritual energy, and brought the whole Inn to The Mana World.
//
//    At time of writing, it is unknown how Asphodel Moors came to be.
//    It is possible that Golbenez cannot return to her original dimension,
//    And it is also possible that her attempt resulted in she ending up in TMW.
//
//    (It is also possible that due the summoning ritual, Golbenez is somehow
//    bound to Savaric and like monster summons, cannot remain in existence if
//    the summoner is dead. If proven, this could change completely the reason
//    why Golbenez kept the whole Inn alive and brought it with her.)
//
//    At time of writing, It is unknown if she is alive, undead, or neither and
//    is a spirit.
//    Other NPCs cannot comprehend and will always treat her as a "him".
//    Most other NPCs cannot say Golbenez' name properly, and will say "Golbanez",
//    "Galvanes", "Gilbenos", "Golbinos" and/or "Galvanis".
//    This is part of lore, please do not try to "fix" it in other NPCs as well.
// THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER!
