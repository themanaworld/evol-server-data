    // [ PC]: I was just looking around.
    // [NPC]: Did not someone offer guidance?
    // [NPC]: Enora was supposed to be helping you...
    // [NPC]: ...but, she is young, and often absent-minded; did you ask?
    // [NPC]: (Alt.) It seems you rushed ahead of her. Go back and talk to Enora.
    //    ([Enora]: Beyond here is the fighting room o_o;)
    //    ([Enora]: I... uh... well, you will need alies in there.)
    //    ([Enora]: And... you see... this is my good outfit and...)
    //    ([Enora]: ...I've only just cleaned up in there >.>)
    //   But if you keep getting stronger; that will be the day.

    // Alt-Ready:
    // [NPC]: Beyond here is the Fight Room.
    // [NPC]: [conditions]*
    // [NPC]: Good-luck | Bonne-chance.

    // (Alt.) [NPC]: I used to be an adventurer, like you.
    // [NPC]: But there was no one to join for quests.
    // [NPC]: So I enlisted for a post at this chapter.
    // [NPC]: But my "friends" joined the Brotherhood!

    // [NPC]: The Brotherhood knows a lot more about monsters.
    // [NPC]: But they could not "break the Legion's power" without burning all cities to the ground.
    // [NPC]: The cities grow fast, ruining farmers and peasants.
    // [NPC]: Our differences lead to friction.

    // Alt-What
    // The secret is out: We really did create a mutant.
    // None of the members were informed until it went out-of-control.
    // [...]
    // Muahaha-ha! My beautiful mutant. The city of Artis is mine.
    // </scratch>

    // Alt-Siege
    // The city is being attacked. Go help the warriors and town-guard.
